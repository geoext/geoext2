 * A base class for sliders that can be rendered as items of a GeoExt.panel.Map.

 * Usually you will not create instances of this class but rather of the

 * This class mostly provides subclasses with the method #addToMapPanel and
 * the method #removeFromMapPanel, which take care of the dimensions of the
 * sliders DOM-elements and register/unregister appropriate eventlisteners.
 *
 * Subclasses may implement #unbind, which will be called when a slider is
 * being removed from the map panel.
